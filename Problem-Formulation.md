Problem Formulation:
-----------------

- Initial state :

play board is empty 

- Successor function : 


    Step 1 : assume we are playing with X, place the first X in the center.

    Step 2 : whatever move the O player will take, place the next X in one of the corners. 

    Step 3: depending on the other player move, place the X in a way that forms a row or a column.

- Goal Test:

Did we complete a row/ column of x/o

- Path Cost: 

Effort and time
